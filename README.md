# FTP Finder

I made this program to find FTP-Servers that allow you to enter with anonymous access. To find the server, I use a random IP generator. 
To ensure the Port is open, I use a Port Scan via Socket, and to assure that the FTP is working correctly, I use ftplib.

Feel free to extend my script and use it for whatever you desire but don't do anything illegal with it.
